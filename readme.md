# Atlas visualization in JS
In an attempt to rewrite the atlas visualization from the forked ShareAtlas repo we will utilize cytoscope to build the entire atlas. Instead of using one pre-defined image as the original author did before.
Current Progress:
- added basic functionality to add/remove nodes
- loads sample data from a pre-defined function
- parsed map data to json
- highlights currently selected map
- shows information about the current object when hovering.
